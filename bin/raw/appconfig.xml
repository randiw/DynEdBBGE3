Woman: When the weather is good, I usually walk to work. On rainy days, I take the bus.

Kent: Do you walk home at night, too?

Woman: Yes, I do, except in winter. In the winter, the sun sets early, so it gets very dark. I don't like to walk after dark. So in the winter, I take the bus home at night.

Woman: But I usually walk to work in the morning.

Kent: Isn't it cold in the winter?

Woman: Yes, it is, but it's not too cold to walk. It helps me to wake up. And it only takes me 20 minutes to walk to work.

Kent: What do you do when it snows?

Woman: When it snows, I take the bus.

Kent: Do you ever drive? Do you ever drive to work?

Guard: Yes.

Kent: Do you work here?

Guard: Yes, I do. I'm the security guard. I work here every night.

Kent: What do you do?

Guard: Mostly I help visitors and answer questions about the Lincoln Memorial.

Kent: I think the Lincoln Memorial is the most beautiful building in Washington.

Guard: Many people think so.

Kent: Especially at night, when the lights are on.

Guard: Well, it's seven o'clock now. It's time to turn on the lights. Do you want to see?

Kent: I sure do.

Guard: OK. Here's the control panel. When I push this button, the outside lights go on. See?

Kent: Yes. What happens when you turn this knob?

Guard: This knob controls the lights on the statue of Abraham Lincoln. When I turn the knob this way, the lights get stronger. When I turn it the other way, the lights get weaker.

Kent: Oh, the building looks so beautiful when the lights are on!

Guard: I think so too. Please take your time and look around.
